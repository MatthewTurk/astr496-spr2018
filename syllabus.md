# Course Description

This course is intended to be a broad overview of many different aspects of
computation in astronomy.  Beginning with developing conversational
computational abilities, we will progress to learning about image processing,
ODE solvers, conducting simulations, using databases, and how computer
architecture can influence speed and reliability of calculations.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience with
computation as applied to astronomy and astrophysics.  This encompasses several
different components, but will primarily focus on items related to simulations,
data processing, visualization, and overall computational skills.  The course
is not designed to provide detailed information about each of these topics, but
instead to provide enough points of information to allow students to follow up
on their own or during future research.

This course will involve a considerable amount of programming as well as
utilizing a Unix-like command line.  We will primarily use Python for in-class
work, but will have forays into C, Fortran, and potentially C++.

The course has two sections each week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday.
Typically, these 90-minute sections will be broken into two components: an
initial lecture, followed by hands-on collaborative work on laptops.  During
the lecture, concepts will be introduced that will be applied during the second
component.

Students are expected to have laptops with them, as well as access to Python
installations, and will be encouraged to participate in class.  

## Pre- and Co-requisites

None, although basic Python programming experience is assumed.

# Course Materials

There is no textbook for this course.  All course materials will be posted to
the GitHub repository at https://github.com/matthewturk/astr496-spr2018/ which
will be automatically built into a website accessible at
matthewturk.github.io/astr496-spr2018/ .

As the course progresses, a list of recommended readings will be generated for
each class.  These will be included in the course materials repository, and
students are encouraged to fork that repository and issue pull requests to add
suggested readings.

# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are

# Accessibility Statement
To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon
as possible.  To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St.,
Champaign, call (217) 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to
disability@illinois.edu.

# Assignments and Evaluation

Students will be graded based on a combination of assignments (70%) and a final
project (30%).  The final project will be a capstone to the course, and will
have greater flexibility in software packages and data sources.  This project
will be introduced in Week 8.

Assignments in this course will be a mixture of coding/visualization work and
written work.  These two may not be distinct assignments; students will be
asked to describe their code and justify choices for making decisions with
respect to visualizations.

Students are expected, unless otherwise instructed, to be the principal authors
of their code.  This does not mean they may not investigate resources such as
StackOverflow, package documentation, etc; however, they *must* cite when
resources (especially StackOverflow and other "recipe" sites) are utilized.

Assignments will take two forms, and will be given at the end of each class.
Students will have until the following class to turn these in; assignments will
be collected electronically.

 * The first type of assignment will be a written document, constituting 
   either a brief literature review or an analysis of a visualization or
   set of visualizations.  The parameters for these assignments will be given
   during class, but will typically involve a critique of a visualization,
   including citing relevant works in the visualization literature.
 * The second type of assignment will be a hands-on, code-based assignment.
   Students will be provided either a dataset *or* a class of datasets from
   which they can choose, and construct one or multiple mechanisms of drawing
   information out of this visually.  These will be submitted in the form of
   Jupyter notebooks.  Each visualization must be accompanied by narrative
   description from the student describing why design decisions were made.

The submission process for homeworks will be described by example during class
before any homeworks are to be submitted.

Each assignment will be 50% "correctness" and 50% the narrative description of
the process.  "Correctness" in this case indicates that the code runs without
issue, results are produced, and each component of the assignment is completed.
The narrative description of the process will be graded on grammar and
completeness.

### Grading Policy

All assignments are required for all students. Completing all assignments is
not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must be completed in order to
pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit
unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).

**Grading Scale:**

| 94-100 = A
| 90-93 = A-
| 87-89 = B+
| 83-86 = B
| 80-82 = B-
| 77-79 = C+
| 73-76 = C
| 70-72 = C-
| 67-69 = D+
| 63-66 = D
| 60-62 = D-
| 59 and below = F

### Incompletes

Students must request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor
and student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework and the
student must file an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and
the student's academic advisor with the School's records representative. More
information on incompletes is available here:
<http://webdocs.ischool.illinois.edu/registration/incomplete_grade_form.pdf>

### Late Assignments

Students are required to attend each class, and if they are unable to do so
much notify the instructor and TA in advance and request an excused absence.
Participation in class -- in the form of comments, questions, and discussion --
is expected.

## Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we're faced with any kind of emergency -- like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you -- we have three options: Run, hide or
fight.


### Run

Leaving the area quickly is the best option if it is safe to do so.

- Take time now to learn the different ways to leave your building.
- Leave personal items behind.
- Assist those who need help, but consider whether doing so puts
  yourself at risk.
- Alert authorities of the emergency when it is safe to do so.

### Hide

When you can't or don't want to run, take shelter indoors.

- Take time now to learn different ways to seek shelter in your building.
- If severe weather is imminent, go to the nearest indoor storm refuge area.
- If someone is trying to hurt you and you can't evacuate, get to a place
  where you can't be seen, lock or barricade your area, silence your
  phone, don't make any noise and don't come out until you receive an
  Illini-Alert indicating it is safe to do so.

### Fight

As a last resort, you may need to fight to increase your chances of
survival.

- Think about what kind of common items are in your area which you
  can use to defend yourself.
- Team up with others to fight if the situation allows.
- Mentally prepare yourself -- you may be in a fight for your life.

Please be aware of persons with disabilities who may need additional
assistance in emergency situations.
