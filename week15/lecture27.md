## (This Is Our) Last Time

For the final lecture today, we're going to talk a little bit more formally
about my thoughts on research strategies in computational astronomy.

Consider this a draft of my own "ten simple rules" for success in computational
astronomy.

(Maybe even a draft letter to my past self?)

---

## Draft Rules

1. Struggling is OK
1. Optimize for the Human Factor
1. Success is not zero-sum
1. Don't tolerate hazing.
1. "Well, actually" 
1. Space to shine.
1. Have more fun than not.
1. Don't tool-shame
1. "Leaving" "the" "Field"
1. You Are Not Your Work

---

## Struggling is OK

There are no lone hero coders.

You will need to ask for help.

You will need to struggle.

*There are no lone hero coders.*

---

## Optimize for the Human Factor

We've talked about this a lot in this class.

Optimize for the human factor:

 * Doing this same thing again
 * Remembering why you did it
 * Getting something now versus getting something later


---

## Success is not zero-sum

As you transition from a student to a researcher it might start to feel like
things are a bit crowded.  Things aren't as crowded as they feel.

Your success will not come at the failure of someone else's.

Someone else's success does not come at your failure.

Science is not about press releases and scoops.

---

## Don't Tolerate Hazing

Computers can be tricky, with in's and out's and what-have-you's.

You should not ever be placed in a situation where you have to "pay your dues"
by doing some grimy work to succeed or be supported in your success.

---

## "Well, actually"

Strike this from your vocabulary and think carefully about the people you hear
say it.

---

## Space to Shine

In graduate school, your relationship with an advisor needs to be bi-directional.

Being a graduate student means being trained to be an independent researcher
and a __colleague__.

Find an advisor who gives you space to shine.

---

## Have more fun than not

Not every moment is rainbows, but a lot can be.

---

## Don't tool-shame

There are many paths to the top of a mountain, and just because one is
differently-worn than the others does not make it bad.

---


## "Leaving" "the" "Field"

This is less of a problem now, but you will probably hear the phrase "leave the
field" or a variant used as a pejorative.

It shouldn't be, and the skills you develop will be more transferable than you
may realize.

---

## You are not your work

---

## Thank you

Thanks, everyone.
